        "This project is centered around developing intelligent algorithms for agents to navigate through partially observable environments with optimal reasoning. The primary focus involves implementing an advanced exploration algorithm, based on A*, to enable the agent to effectively address our objectives. The agent's goal is to navigate sensibly within randomly generated rooms. It has to identify specific objects to recognize different room types, locate the target object and reach it. We used NetHack as the foundational framework for this project, offering a rich and complex environment for the development and testing of intelligent exploration algorithms.<br>\n",

        "[MiniHack](https://minihack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/interface.html) is a software tool tailored for AI experimentation. It provides a simplified version of NetHack Learning Environment (NLE) with reduced complexity. It offers a controlled environment for training and testing AI agents and algorithms.<br>\n",
        "[Gym]( https://www.gymlibrary.dev/index.html), by OpenAI, is a toolkit for reinforcement learning that provides a standardized interface for various environments, including MiniHack. In this collaboration, Gym acts as a bridge, allowing AI agents to interact with MiniHack through its standardized interface. By initializing Gym and MiniHack in our Python environment, we  develop an AI agents that exploit optimized searching algorithm for perform our task in a controlled environment. This setup enables efficient experimentation and algorithm refinement for AI tasks within MiniHack.<br>\n",

Bayes' formula is used to calculate and update the probabilities of being in each room, saved within a list in which each item represents the probability of being in the corresponding room.\n",
        "The updating of the probabilities is performed using the percentages calculated at the previous iterations and the percentages of finding the observed object in each room.\n",
        "Such exploration continues until the agent runs out of explorable cells or gains sufficient knowledge about the type of room he is in. In case the predetermined threshold of 95% is exceeded, the agent heads directly to the associated target object, thus concluding the execution of the exploration process.\n",

TFFFM computes the Manhattan distance between the agent's position and the target and then adds a penalty term for each wall between the agent and the target following the founded path. This heuristic allows choosing as new target a cell that is as close as possible to the agent's position while penalizing paths that involve traversing walls.\n",

Instead of the original game map, A* operates on a pre-conditioned map created by us. The pre-conditioned map is generated by adding \"fake walls\" along all paths adjacent to the walls, ensuring that these additions do not block any path.\n",
        "The A* algorithm works on the conditioned map and returns a path constantly 1 cell away from the walls of the original game map. Since the agent can perceive adjacent cells, moving to a cell next to the wall would be unnecessary, as it can still be observed with one step less.\n",

All results that will be shown are taken as average on 1000 runs, starting from a random location in the chosen map. The first test consists regards the comparison of the number of steps taken by the agent to explore the entire map when using different distances in the customized A* implementation. As we can see from the graph below, the number of steps taken by the agent is comparable between all the different distances, with a slight advantage for the TFFFM distance. This result is expected since this custom distance is the most accurate for our problem, as it is the only one that adds a penalty term when considering the walls between the agent and the target, namely the closest unvisited cell in the maze. The other distances, instead, are affected by the presence of walls, which can lead to suboptimal paths.\n",
